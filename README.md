Wind Viewer is a level viewer and editor for Zelda: Wind Waker and (to an extent) Twilight Princess.

Original author: [xDaniel](http://magicstone.de/dzd/)

#Compiling the Project#
WindViewer is written using Visual Studios 2012. This means the project solutions are **incompatible with previous versions**. To solve this issue, you can get the Virtual Studios 2012 Service Pack 1 to enable compatibility with Visual Studios 2010. Other versions will require modifying the Solution file to open.
